We will take a flash loan (through a flash swap) from the Uniswap V2 pool. One consideration is that an estimated 0.03% of the loan must be repaid in a fee. Since the player only has 0.1eth, we can only really take a 30 eth or so loan, but 15 eth will suffice. The vunerability is that the marketplace contract sends the eth to the buyer. So we can take the weth flash loan, unwrap it, use it to buy the first nft, then when the eth is returned, use it again to buy the next NFT. At the end of this, we have 15 eth and all the NFTs. We will also have the player transfer an additional 0.05 WETH to the attack contract for the fee. Then return the total amount to repay the flash loan. Finally, we send all the NFTs to the recovery contract using `safeTransferFrom()` and pass the player address in the arbitrary bytes to claim the reward.
